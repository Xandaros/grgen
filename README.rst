GrGen: The Graph Rewrite Generator
==================================

Welcome to GrGen!

GrGen.NET is a software development tool that offers programming languages optimized for graph-structured data, with declarative pattern matching and rewriting at their core, with support for imperative and object-oriented programming, and a bit of database-like query-result processing.
The languages are brought to life by a compiler emitting highly efficient assemblies and a rapid prototyping environment offering graphical and step-wise debugging.
The Graph Rewrite GENerator eases the transformation of graph-based representations, as they are needed in e.g. engineering, model transformation, computer linguistics, or compiler construction.
